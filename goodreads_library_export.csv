I fully disagree the author wasn’t transparent about the competing perspectives on most points of contention and treated the subject very fairly. The author had a better eye for nuance than most and did not give in too much to sensationalism. <br/><br/>I do agree it was a slog at times. The author even seems to betray his original theme of avoiding “one damned battle after another” with pages and pages of this city surrendered and was slaughtered or this city held out for two weeks and on and on. We could have done without a lot of that and pursued richer material, which the author seems to have wanted to on several points but for some reason held back from. I really liked his asides and contextual framing even though some went on too long and didn’t seem very relevant (my favorite kind of relevancy, sometimes) or, worse, ended too soon with huge questions unanswered. That’s fine, just new avenues of interest opened and more books to add to the ever growing backlog. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe is the authors interest seems to wax and wane throughout the project. The result is a bit of inconsistency, great energy and promise at the onset, the long slog of rote information, and then a rush to the finish. Who he chose to focus on times seemed like it was motivated out of some personal interest or maybe just the sources were better. It would have been worth more to his initial stated goal to cut content and touch more on how the empire fell apart, who filled the vacuum, and how that played out to the modern day. Instead we just leave it as there were four major khanates therefore the story was over for the mongols. One of those Khanates ruled China and the other was literally called the Golden Horde, so we had more to talk about, I think. <br/><br/>To top off the complement sandwich, the author did a great job talking about the cultural, social, and political aspects that made this episode in history seem almost inevitable. I came to this book trying to understand how a bunch of pastoralists conquered China and half the rest of the world and who the man that took the reins on this was. It really was just the exact right (and phenomenally lucky) person at the exact right place and exact right time. The end result was what we got, a short lived and seemingly random episode that will forever have altered all of human history. <br/><br/>Long story short, I learned a ton but wish I’d skipped some pages.",,,1,0

A lot of the negative reviews mention it being too people or history focused and not enough concrete about the science of complexity. I’d try and find that in a textbook. <br/><br/>The author did a great job capturing the unique backgrounds of the major players and the themes that unified them, and ultimately led to the study of complexity.<br/><br/>As an overview and introduction, it opens up a lot of avenues and covers all background concepts that every course or textbook I’ve seen on complexity is organized around. My only criticism is the Anglo-centrism of it. As with most things, the scientists involved didn’t pull this out of thin air, and there’s probably even more going on at this point around these studies outside the States. ",,,1,0

On one hand, it seems to preempt the entire complex systems movement and a considerable amount of the language and examples used within by several years, decades in some cases. Bertalanffy’s work on open systems alone should make him very closely linked and studied, and some of the discussions here of transitions between chaos and order were way ahead of their time. Yet none of these authors or “general systems theory” seem to have any connection with other nonlinear systems/complex systems people that very much took off. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the way Bertalanffy is written about and how he is placed at the mantle of this movement is very cult-like. With Ervin Laszlo being his main disciple and he having done seemingly nothing for the ideas described here or in general systems theory, instead going completely off the deep-end into full blown crank territory, I’m seeing why this book reads so strangely and general systems theory is basically dead. <br/><br/>I think these ideas are good and that they were stolen or otherwise absorbed into modern complex systems science. I think these general systems guys were trying to take an even more interdisciplinary approach than the “complex systems” orbit of people and attempting a serious unity of philosophy with their science. Unfortunately, unlike the Santa Fe institute, they didn’t come with their own high level of scientific and mathematical rigor and pedigree, which allowed the whole enterprise to stutter and die in a pudding of bullshit once Bertalanffy kicked the bucket and Laszlo started talking about things like “quantum consciousness.” <br/><br/>In conclusion, there are some really good ideas here. I’d say this book is worthwhile to anyone with an interest in the areas of Complex systems, the more legitimate and modern version of general systems theory. I might take a deeper look at Bertalanffy’s other work. ",,,1,0

It’s one of those cult classics that appears again and again in the less mainstream reading lists of people who seem to have an extra thoughtful bone or two than most in their body. <br/><br/>The central theme would certainly revolve around the “universe in a grain of sand” of eastern religions, trying to connect the Oneness of the Tao to something so western by juxtaposition, motorcycle maintenance. Flow states, the beauty of losing yourself in the mundane and making it always a singular, fully present experience and immersion with what is mostly just a chore. I was familiar with most of these ideas as they appear occasionally as a glaze in other works. <br/><br/>I’m glad I went in thinking I knew. I’m glad I had these preconceptions. Being so wrong and watching the absolute evaporation of what I thought I knew as this book just evolved and surprised, flying higher and higher and taking more sharp, strange turns left me all the more speechless until I gave up trying to anticipate and just enjoyed the experience. <br/><br/>This work might not be for everyone. Any such utterly unique work of this level of craftsmanship and complete disregard for connection to the common thread of thought (the mythos, or zeitgeist, if you will) is naturally going to lose more than a few people. <br/><br/>I don’t know where I’m going with this review. This was the first book I’ve ever read that truly, genuinely surprised me.<br/>I can usually connect the dots of an authors theme or thesis and see where they are going, extrapolating on their stated thesis with what I already know to be true or widely believed in their field, and only read on in the hopes something completely unexpected will appear or for the extra flesh they add to the framework. <br/><br/>Not so here. Again and again the ride took me into a new and beautiful territory, yet this territory felt like home the second I saw it. <br/><br/>Maybe I need more time to think about things before posting a real review. All I can really say, and this may be a purely personal point of view, is that this is the single most important and incredible book I have ever read.",,,1,0

Everything you ever wanted to know about the Celts 1000 B.C. to the present,Kevin Duffy,"Duffy, Kevin",,"=""0760716080""","=""9780760716083""",3,3.49,Fall River Press,Hardcover,250,2000,1996,2020/06/24,2020/06/24,,,read,"Not quite everything I ever wanted to know. More like a very good primer. <br/><br/>Many will review this book harshly, and in fact many have, because the author must rely on narrative at some points. <br/><br/>But I sympathize with the author, and more generally for any scholars of the Celts. They left few records of themselves, almost everything we have is from outside sources of dubious reliability and bias. At the end of the day, a historian, barring any more evidence, has to take a leap of faith. Sometimes over a matter of fierce controversial debate all the way up to the highest levels of current scholarship. <br/><br/>The writing is simple and at times repetitive, but what the author lacks in poetic license he makes up for in a reliable hosing of information. <br/><br/>It’s also true there is a lot of cheerleading about the Irish, but a good faith interpretation is that the author simply has passion for his topic and needs to hook potential readers with that enthusiastic energy. As for other comments that say there is an excessive hatred about the Romans, I didn’t quite read things that way. The Romans were natural and central antagonists to the celts and I think the author did a decent job maintaining a historians professional removal in detailing this conflict. <br/><br/>One more point, the most important, the chronology is indeed difficult. The author doesn’t follow a very linear timeline of Celtic history. It’s almost left as an exercise for the reader to draw a map and piece dates together in a more sensical fashion. <br/><br/>All in all, I’d say the information you can get in these short 200 odd pages is analogous to watching a really, really, long PBS documentary that would bore you to sleep over the course of 8 hours. I read the book in about 4 hours, so you’re twice as efficient and half as likely to pass out to the sound of some stiff narrator. <br/><br/>3 stars for those of casual curiosity. 5 stars for someone, like me, just looking for a beachfront for later assaults on the subject matter.

I’ve given this book 5 stars for the subject itself as well as the authors very lively writing and educated and reasonable vetting of legend and myth around it. <br/><br/>John Paul Jones is a legend not well known outside of history and naval buffs. Scratch just one layer deep into The Revolutionary War, American Naval history, or just great patriots in general and he will stick out through the prodigious amount of legend around the man. <br/><br/>What Thomson presents instead, especially shocking in the first few chapters for one with only this legend exposure to the man is a portrait of a very human subject. <br/><br/>From humble beginnings, Jones rise is a very American story that goes in twine with that of the New World. Thomson paints Jones close to what he was, drawing from the prodigious amount of personal correspondence by and about the man from himself and (some times not so) reliable contemporaries. ",,,1,0
